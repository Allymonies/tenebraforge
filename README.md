# kristforge

GPU-accelerated cross platform Krist miner, using OpenCL

## Download

Pre-built 64-bit binaries for Linux and Windows can be found on the
[release page](https://github.com/tmpim/kristforge/releases).

## Usage

The complete usage of kristforge can be found by running `kristforge help` and `kristforge help <subcommand>`, but the
basic usage for mining Krist is `kristforge mine <address>`. Unlike previous OpenCL miners, kristforge 3 automatically
adjusts work size to maximize performance.
